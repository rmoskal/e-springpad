<en-note> Aristotle<br clear="none"/>Nicomachean Ethics, I,3,1094,1<br clear="none"/><br clear="none"/>Our discussion will be adequate if its has as much clearness as the subject-matter admits of, for precision is not to be sought for alike in all discussions, any more than in all products of the crafts. n Now fine and just actions, which political science investigates, admit of much variety and flunctuation of of opinion so that they may be thought to exist only by convention and not by nature.  And goods also exhibit a similar fluctuiation because they bring harm to many people...We must be content, then, in speaking of such subjects and with such premises to indicate truth roughly and and in outline, and in speaking of things which are only for the most part true and with premises of the same kind to reach conclusions that are no better.  In the same spirit, therefore, should each type statement be received, for it is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in each class of things  just so far as each class of the subject admits.<br clear="none"/></en-note>]]></content><created>20100314T074906Z</created><tag>A</tag><note-attributes><author>rmoskal01@gmail.com</author><source>Google Notebook</source></note-attributes></note><note><title>Adorno, T.W.

<en-note>Adorno, T.W.<br clear="none"/>Negative Dialectics, p.23.<br clear="none"/><br clear="none"/>Yet the process in which the systems decomposed, due to their own insufficiency, stands in counterpoint to a social process. In the form of the barter principle, the bourgeois ratio really approximated to the systems whatever it would make commensurable with itself, would identify with itself, would identify with iteslf--and it did so with increasing, if potentially homicidal, success.  What proved idle in theory was ironically borne out in practice. <br clear="none"/></en-note>]]></content><created>20080107T223346Z</created><tag>A</tag><note-attributes><author>rmoskal@mostmedia.com</author><source>Google Notebook</source></note-attributes></note><note><title>Dipert, Randall Artifacts, Art Works, and Agency, Temple University Press, Ph...</title><content><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

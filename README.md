e-springpad
===========

Source code for the evernote springpad translator found here: http://e-springpad.appspot.com/

The translator works quite well for text notes and I hope someone expands it to support a wider variety of data.

There's nothing more to say than....

The app runs on the google app engine, I think it is still python 2.5 based.

On the earlier version of the app engine sdk  I was forced to patch a bunch of fairly standard libraries.  Perhaps if someone updates this to a later version of python, this requirement will go away.
